\textbf{\Large ABSTRACT}\\
\end{center}

\begin{normalsize}
 Solar Tracking and Automatic Irrigation is a modern solution designed to enhance agriculture by improving water management, increasing crop yields, and reducing environmental impact. It addresses challenges such as water scarcity and climate change that affect traditional irrigation methods. The Solar Tracking and Automatic Irrigation integrates essential components: soil moisture sensors for precise scheduling, weather data for informed decisions, and real-time monitoring with intelligent algorithms for effective irrigation. This system focuses on conserving electricity and water. Automating the irrigation setup is to enable remote control and monitoring of the status of the setup even when farmer is away from the location.This paper proposes a new system with the use of advanced sensors and a Telegram Bot to provide SMS acknowledgment whenever there is any critical action that is initiated during the process. This includes water being pumped in excess to a crop, there is too much of sunlight for a sustained period and many other critical situations. The farmer will then have opportunity to, ARDUINO UNO,DC WATER PUMP,Moister Sensor, take necessary action It offers a sustainable solution for agriculture by optimizing water usage, improving crop yields, and reducing resource consumption.\\[12pt]

\textbf{1.1. Objective}
\end{large}\\
The objectives of the Solar Tracking and Automatic Irrigation project include
optimizing water usage through moisture sensors, enhancing energy efficiency
with solar tracking, ensuring climate resilience via weather analytics, enabling re-
mote monitoring and control, improving crop yields through automated irrigation,
emphasizing resource conservation, and promoting technological advancements
in agriculture. The project aims to provide a holistic solution that addresses key
challenges in farming while leveraging modern technologies for sustainability and
increased productivity.
\\

\begin{large}
\textbf{1.2. Problem Definition}
\end{large}\\

The problem addressed by the proposed Solar Tracking and Automatic Irri-
gation system lies in the inefficiencies and challenges inherent in traditional agri-
cultural practices. Specifically, the issues of water scarcity and the adverse ef-
fects of climate change pose significant obstacles to conventional irrigation meth-
ods. Traditional approaches lack precision in water management and fail to adapt
to changing environmental conditions. The reliance on manual intervention for
monitoring and control further exacerbates the problem, especially when farm-
ers are physically distant from their fields. The proposed system seeks to rectify
these issues by introducing advanced components such as soil moisture sensors,
weather data analytics, and intelligent algorithms, aiming to optimize water usage,
increase crop yields, and reduce resource consumption. The identified problems
revolve around the need for a sustainable and technologically advanced solution
to address the limitations and inefficiencies of traditional agricultural practices in
the context of evolving environmental challenges.

In the prevailing irrigation systems, drip irrigation and surface irrigation represent distinctive approaches with varying implications for agricultural practices. Drip irrigation, an advanced and targeted methodology, involves the precise delivery of water directly to the root zones of plants through an intricate network of tubes and emitters. This system is celebrated for its notable advantages, including heightened water conservation, minimized evaporation losses, and adaptability to diverse farming scales. Drip irrigation is particularly lauded for its efficiency in resource utilization, making it an attractive choice for farmers aiming to optimize crop yields while minimizing water consumption.
Contrastingly, surface irrigation encompasses several traditional techniques, each characterized by the distribution of water over the soil surface. Methods such as furrow irrigation, where water flows in small channels along crop rows, basin irrigation, which involves forming basins around individual or groups of plants, and flood irrigation, submerging the entire field, are integral components of surface irrigation. While these methods are simpler and often more accessible, they pose challenges related to potential water wastage due to evaporation and runoff. The efficiency of surface irrigation is influenced by factors such as soil type, slope, and infrastructure.
The choice between drip and surface irrigation hinges on various considerations, including the type of crops being cultivated, available resources, and the local agricultural landscape. As sustainable farming practices gain prominence, the ongoing evolution of irrigation systems reflects a continuous quest for methods that balance efficiency, resource conservation, and optimal crop production.

In the decision-making flow chart for irrigation, the process begins with the crucial step of measuring soil moisture levels using specialized sensors. This initial assessment serves as a pivotal parameter in determining the irrigation requirements for the given agricultural environment. If the measured soil moisture falls below the predefined threshold, the system proceeds to additional checks to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the irrigation needs.

    Following this, the system incorporates a temperature assessment component to ensure that environmental conditions are conducive to effective irrigation. If the current temperature is within the suitable range for irrigation, the process advances to the evaluation of additional conditions. These conditions may encompass various factors such as the time of day, weather conditions, or other specific environmental parameters that could influence the decision-making process.
\end{justify}
\\
\begin{justify}
    Upon the successful fulfillment of all conditions, the system initiates the irrigation process, strategically delivering water to the plants.

\end{justify}
\\
\begin{justify}
    The decision-making flow chart incorporates a critical feedback loop, where the system checks whether the desired soil moisture level has been attained. If the desired level is not reached, the irrigation process continues to meet the specific moisture requirements of the soil. Conversely, if the soil moisture reaches the desired level, the system intelligently ceases irrigation to prevent overwatering, a practice that not only conserves water resources but also avoids potential harm to the plants caused by excessive moisture.
